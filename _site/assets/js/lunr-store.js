        "text": "Digital Preservation: An Overview  Digital preservation is defined as the “formal endeavor to ensure that digital information of continuing value remains accessible and usable.” This means that our main goals in Digital Initiatives and this lab are two-fold: Our first goal being access, our second goal being use. The University of Idaho Library houses thousands of primary research sources, most held in Special Collections and Archives. In and of themselves, these sources provide insight to not only the history of the University, Idaho, and the Northwest, but also Agricultural Science development and Life-Science development.  We are the forefront of making these sources accessible and usable for the public and for researchers, locally and around the world. Our digitization efforts allow the information in materials to be accessed more broadly and used for more projects while still keeping originals intact and available for local, non-circulating, use. The images we create, the information we publish, all directly relates to the original source material; our descriptions, our dates, our titles, all relate to our goals of access and use.  The materials we are working with in this lab are not designated to leave the library either because of their value (irreplaceable, original copy, monetary cost of replacement) or their condition (too fragile to circulate, too delicate to withstand continuous handling). Because of this, it is our job to accurately represent information in a way that upholds the integrity of the materials. This means that we must provide accurate and detailed descriptions of items (photographs, texts, journals, etc.) and do our best efforts to research subjects, dates, and locations in order to make access and use possible for the largest possible audience.  Metadata, or “data about the data”, is how we provide all of the related information about an item to our audience. In this lab, we follow the Simple Dublin Core Metadata Practices, a set standard for types of information and how it is formatted; these standards make it easier for people creating metadata to know that the information they are creating is usable and accessible across multiple search platforms and research methods.   How we apply these standards across all fields are laid out in the procedures portion of this document.  Digitizing collections and materials is a large part of what we do to provide access. Ways that we digitize materials include scanning, photographing, transferring, and recording. Each of these results in a digital copy of an “analog” (hard-copy) item. Each format has a standard that we strive to achieve, and guidelines for editing and finalizing digital copies. Scanned items result in the creation of three digital copies; audio formats result in two digital copies; video formats can range from one copy to two. The standards for each of these digitized method will be covered in the procedures portion of this document. "

        "title": "Scanning",
        "text": "Why do we scan?  Digitizing materials by scanning them with a flatbed, large format, or feed scanner is sometimes the safest and most effective means of preserving the information in an item and allowing others to access it. Scanning items at a high resolution allows the item to be used in different ways without needing to make any manipulations to the actual item. This is why we aim for a minimum 600 dpi image; It provides a scalable image that can be used for large or small reprints that maintains the original details of the item.  Make sure that hands are clean and dry when handling materials for scanning or any type of digitization work; all materials should be handled with care, and cotton gloves worn when instructed by a supervisor. These items cannot be replaced or easily repaired if destroyed or damaged. More detailed instructions on the process of scanning can be found in the two documents included in this manual titled Working with Scanned Images and Scanning Images and Documents.    Scanning images and documents  Scanned files should be named using the following standardized naming rules: CollectionAbbreviation_box#_envelope/folder#-item#subitem  Examples:    Manuscript Group 190, Box 4, Folder 2, letter 1, multiple pages: MG190_b4_f2-001a   Photograph Group 3, box 1, photograph 3: PG3_b1-003   Photographs, negatives and slides:     Turn on scanner at assigned station. Open EpsonScan scanning software. Place item to be scanned along the left side of the scanning bed (glass plate) leaving a slight border between item and edge.   Position the Color Separation Guide so that the “saturated” bar is beside the item being scanned (along the bottom of the item is fine), making sure to leave a 1/8-inch gap. a.\tIf the item is smaller than the guide, you do not have to include the entire guide in the scan; only leave as much in as balances the item.   Scanned images should be at least 6,000 pixels on the long edge. This measurement is located at the bottom left of the preview panel (generated after you press “Preview”). The color filter should be set to “none”. a.\tAlways double check the scanning destination (your personal folder in Daily Scans on the Desktop) and the format (.TIFF) in the scan settings panel that appears after pressing “Scan”.   Once a box, folder, or project has been completely scanned, convert the files to JPEG using the Working with Scanned Images document as a guide.   Documents:     All documents should be scanned at 400 dpi with the color filter set to “none”. Depending on the size of the document and the scanner used, the Color Separation Guide should be used following the same guidelines recommended above.            When using the feed scanner, double check your scanner settings and file destinations before beginning the project. Files should be saved directly to your personal folder in Daily Scans on the Desktop.           Once a folder, box, or project is completely scanned, convert the files to JPEG using the Working with Scanned Images document as a guide.   Convert files in the web jpeg folder to a PDF by selecting the file/s you need, right-clicking and selecting either “Convert to Adobe PDF” or “Combine supported files in Acrobat”.            Under Tools, select Recognize Text &gt; in this file and run text recognition.           Save file as a PDF following the naming rule listed at the top of the page.   File Transfers:  At the end of the week, or end of the project, move all of the files from your personal folder in Daily Scans to your student folder on the W: drive (W: Digital Archives &gt; Students &gt; (your personal folder)).    Working with Scanned Images     In your project folder in Daily Scans, create three folders and name them: tif, access jpeg, lowres jpeg.            Move all scanned images so far into the tif folder.           Open the first image you scanned in Photoshop (right-click&gt;open with&gt;Photoshop)   In Photoshop, go to: File&gt;Automate&gt;Batch   In the Batch window, select the action “tif&gt;jpeg”            For the Source, make sure folder is selected. Click Choose and select the tif folder.       For the Destination, make sure folder is selected. Click Choose and select the access jpeg folder.           Click OK.   After Photoshop has completed the action, make sure all the images have scanned to the correct folder.   In your Access JPEG folder, open images in Photoshop and crop out the color bar. Balance images accordingly.   Go back into Photoshop and go to: File&gt;Automate&gt;Batch   In the Batch window, select the action “300dpijpeg”.            For the Source, make sure folder is selected. Click Choose and select the folder to which all of your adjusted jpeg images were saved.       For the Destination, make sure folder is selected. Click Choose and select the lowres jpeg folder you created. Make sure the file path reads the correct destination.           Click OK.   After Photoshop has completed the action, make sure all the images have been saved to the correct folder.   Email Jess when you have completed a folder, box, or project and have converted all files to both access jpeg and lowres jpeg.   Converting to PDF     Select file/s to be converted from your lowres jpeg folder.   Right-click once items are selected and select either “Convert to Adobe PDF” or “Combine supported files in Acrobat”   Under Tools, select Recognize Text &gt; In this file.   Wait until Adobe Acrobat completes the command (the document will end up back at the first page).   Save the document as a PDF following the naming rules established on Scanning Images and Documents.   Email Jess when you have completed a folder, box, or project and have converted all files to both access jpeg and lowres jpeg.  "

        "title": "Metadata",
        "text": "How do we describe things?  In this lab we use the Simple Dublin Core Metadata Practices, which provides us a standard for how we format our descriptions and make the information readable for a large audience. This section will cover the details of the different formats and guidelines for all common sections of a metadata sheet that technicians will encounter.  Not all of the fields listed below will appear on every metadata sheet. Some metadata sheets will have extra fields depending on the subject material. As a general rule, though, these are the most common fields you will encounter when entering metadata. It may seem like a lot of information, but each field serves a purpose for both preservation and access.  Common Metadata Fields     Title: either the given title of an article or item, unique to that one item. For photographs in a series, this can be either “Founder’s Day parade [01]” (no quotation marks in entry) or a generalized brief description of the photograph. All words after the first word in the title should be lower case unless referring to a proper noun such as a name or place (Dylan Fuller, Empire State Building, Idaho, etc.)   Description: a detailed accounting of the item. This includes small details such as “mountains can be seen in the background”, and should include names when known and list if either person or place is unknown in the material. All descriptions should be in complete sentences and single spaced between sentences.   Creator: this is the individual or company that created the item. For articles or publications, this is the author. For photographs, either the photographer or the studio. Last name, first name “nickname” middle name maiden name, birthdate-death date if known. This is considered an enhancer for the material, and can be linked to records already available on the internet. This increases the usability and accessibility of our collections to a much broader audience.   Date: refers to the date the item was created/published. This field is required and CANNOT BE LEFT BLANK. This entry is represented in YYYY-MM-DD format officially. Other acceptable formats include:            YYYY when no other information is provided       YYYY-MM when no day is provided       YYYY/YYYY for a range where the event is continuously occurring           Date is Approximate: This field lets anyone looking at the collection know that we are certain of our estimation, not that our estimation is the accurate date. Only fill out yes if the Year, Year-Month, or an actual estimation is provided. If date is accurate, leave blank.   Keywords: words or phrases that describe or relate to the material. Think of keywords as how you the technician would search for the item. Another way to think of keywords is in terms of subjects. What subjects are described/depicted? These allow researchers and people interested in looking for one thing in particular to narrow the collections down to their interests. We use the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus for our keywords, which can be found bookmarked in Google Chrome on all of the computers in the lab. Multiple entries are encouraged when possible, and should be separated with a semi-colon. [Example: cows (mammals); farming (function)]. Some collections have a controlled vocabulary related to the subject material.   Relation: This field indicates if there are any relationships between resources. An example of this would be if a collection contains material from another collection, or is similar to material in another collection. This is not an often used field, and will usually be populated by the Digital Projects Manager.  Sometimes it gets cross-referenced as Spatial Coverage, but you will be notified before-hand.   Spatial Coverage: Spatial coverage identifies the geographic and/or geospatial location of the item being described. If it is a photograph, list the location that is depicted; if it is an article or other textual material, list the location described. Locations should always be listed: Country—State—County—City—Identifier.   Latitude/Longitude: Geospatial coordinates on the surface of the Earth. To find these coordinates, please use Google Maps (www.maps.google.com) or iTouchMap (itouchmap.com/latlong.html). Copy/paste the coordinates from either of these sites into the field in the metadata sheet. If Excel tries to reformat it to only 2 or 3 decimal places, right-click on the Letter at the top of the column and select format. In the window that pops up, select number, and increase decimal places to 6. Sometimes this field is split into separate entries; other times it will be a combined entry.   Digital Collection: This field contains the name of the digital collection to which all of the material you are working with belongs. It lets patrons, researchers, and those viewing the item know where they can find more materials related to this item in case they found it by searching for a subject, or through another linked entry. This also provides a connection with the physical material and helps individuals to know where it is located. The collection name will usually be completed by the Digital Projects Manager.   Contributing Institution: most of our digital collections are owned by the University of Idaho Library, but some of them originate from other institutions or individuals. Some digital collections are combinations of UI Library materials and materials from other institutions. Citing the contributing Institution notes attribution as well as protects UI from potential copyright issues. This field will always be filled in by the Digital Projects Manager unless it is specified in the collection on an individual item basis.   Source: the original source of the material being scanned. Sometimes this is a single collection here at UI, sometimes it’s pieces of another collection presented in a different collection. A lot of the time, this will also be the call number or collection number or the physical reference of the item, so people are able to find the item in person if they want to.   Original File Name: refers to either the collection of numbers and letters that designate its location within the library or the original file name that may have been edited to fit our standards here at the library. This field won’t always be on every metadata entry sheet.   Identifier: file name, minus the extension (.jpg, .tif, .pdf, etc.) Identifiers let both viewer and the Digital Projects Manager recognize and find the digital item in the archive quickly. Without the correct identifier, the viewer is left to either the title or description to request a copy of the item, which can get difficult with the number of digital records the Library has.   Rights: a copyright statement that consists of a free-text statement and a standardized rights statement. These statements indicate to viewers and researchers if permissions are required to use the material in publication, and how to attribute the item once used. A list of these can be found in your student folder in both Daily Scans on the Desktop and in your student folder in the W: drive. If you have any questions or aren’t certain of which statement applies to your project, ask the Digital Projects Manager.   Example of free-text statement: No Copyright. Material made available by donor/contributing institution/source (as applicable). For more information, please contact University of Idaho Library Special Collections and Archives Department at libspec@uidaho.edu.            Example of standardized rights statement: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/           Format Original: what was the item originally? A photograph? A newspaper clipping? This field specifies what the object was before digitization. Examples of original formats include: black-and-white photograph, color photograph, article, scrapbook, newspaper clipping, magazine, etc. There is no controlled vocabulary for this field.   Type: this field indicates what the material contains. If it is an audio recording, input Sound; for video, input Image; MovingImage. Image refers to any form of picture or visual representation of an item, while Text can refer to any typed or written material. You may have multiple types per item, such as a newspaper clipping that contains an image and the related article.   Digital Format: the digital format of the item. If the material is a PDF, the corresponding type is application/pdf; if the material is an image, the corresponding type is image/jpeg. Audio and video have similar entry styles. This field lets the viewer know what format the uploaded material is, and what they can expect when requesting the item for either publication or personal use. If you have questions, please refer to the Digital Projects Manager.   Language: a three-letter abbreviation or code for the language used in the material. Most items in our digital collections are in English, or have an English translation attached to them. For this field, always input eng unless otherwise instructed.   Filename: identifier PLUS extension (.jpg, .tif, .pdf, .wav, etc.) Our digital content management system uses this field to correctly link the digitized item to the corresponding metadata entry. When possible, a pre-set formula will add the correct extension to each identifier entered in previous columns to save from any re-entry errors.  "
