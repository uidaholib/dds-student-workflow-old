      <h1 id="why-do-we-scan">Why do we scan?</h1>

<p>Digitizing materials by scanning them with a flatbed, large format, or feed scanner is sometimes the safest and most effective means of preserving the information in an item and allowing others to access it. Scanning items at a high resolution allows the item to be used in different ways without needing to make any manipulations to the actual item. This is why we aim for a minimum 600 dpi image; It provides a scalable image that can be used for large or small reprints that maintains the original details of the item.  Make sure that hands are clean and dry when handling materials for scanning or any type of digitization work; all materials should be handled with care, and cotton gloves worn when instructed by a supervisor. These items cannot be replaced or easily repaired if destroyed or damaged. More detailed instructions on the process of scanning can be found in the two documents included in this manual titled Working with Scanned Images and Scanning Images and Documents.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="scanning-images-and-documents">Scanning images and documents</h1>

<p>Scanned files should be named using the following standardized naming rules: CollectionAbbreviation_box#_envelope/folder#-item#subitem</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manuscript Group 190, Box 4, Folder 2, letter 1, multiple pages: MG190_b4_f2-001a</li>
  <li>Photograph Group 3, box 1, photograph 3: PG3_b1-003</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="photographs-negatives-and-slides">Photographs, negatives and slides:</h5>

<ol>
  <li>Turn on scanner at assigned station. Open EpsonScan scanning software. Place item to be scanned along the left side of the scanning bed (glass plate) leaving a slight border between item and edge.</li>
  <li>Position the Color Separation Guide so that the “saturated” bar is beside the item being scanned (along the bottom of the item is fine), making sure to leave a 1/8-inch gap.
a.	If the item is smaller than the guide, you do not have to include the entire guide in the scan; only leave as much in as balances the item.</li>
  <li>Scanned images should be at least 6,000 pixels on the long edge. This measurement is located at the bottom left of the preview panel (generated after you press “Preview”). The color filter should be set to “none”.
a.	Always double check the scanning destination (your personal folder in Daily Scans on the Desktop) and the format (.TIFF) in the scan settings panel that appears after pressing “Scan”.</li>
  <li>Once a box, folder, or project has been completely scanned, convert the files to JPEG using the Working with Scanned Images document as a guide.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="documents">Documents:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>All documents should be scanned at 400 dpi with the color filter set to “none”. Depending on the size of the document and the scanner used, the Color Separation Guide should be used following the same guidelines recommended above.
    <ul>
      <li>When using the feed scanner, double check your scanner settings and file destinations before beginning the project. Files should be saved directly to your personal folder in Daily Scans on the Desktop.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once a folder, box, or project is completely scanned, convert the files to JPEG using the Working with Scanned Images document as a guide.</li>
  <li>Convert files in the web jpeg folder to a PDF by selecting the file/s you need, right-clicking and selecting either “Convert to Adobe PDF” or “Combine supported files in Acrobat”.
    <ul>
      <li>Under Tools, select Recognize Text &gt; in this file and run text recognition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Save file as a PDF following the naming rule listed at the top of the page.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="file-transfers">File Transfers:</h5>

<p>At the end of the week, or end of the project, move all of the files from your personal folder in Daily Scans to your student folder on the W: drive (W: Digital Archives &gt; Students &gt; (your personal folder)).</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="working-with-scanned-images">Working with Scanned Images</h1>

<ol>
  <li>In your project folder in Daily Scans, create three folders and name them: tif, access jpeg, lowres jpeg.
    <ul>
      <li>Move all scanned images so far into the tif folder.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Open the first image you scanned in Photoshop (right-click&gt;open with&gt;Photoshop)</li>
  <li>In Photoshop, go to: File&gt;Automate&gt;Batch</li>
  <li>In the Batch window, select the action “tif&gt;jpeg”
    <ul>
      <li>For the Source, make sure folder is selected. Click Choose and select the tif folder.</li>
      <li>For the Destination, make sure folder is selected. Click Choose and select the access jpeg folder.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
  <li>After Photoshop has completed the action, make sure all the images have scanned to the correct folder.</li>
  <li>In your Access JPEG folder, open images in Photoshop and crop out the color bar. Balance images accordingly.</li>
  <li>Go back into Photoshop and go to: File&gt;Automate&gt;Batch</li>
  <li>In the Batch window, select the action “300dpijpeg”.
    <ul>
      <li>For the Source, make sure folder is selected. Click Choose and select the folder to which all of your adjusted jpeg images were saved.</li>
      <li>For the Destination, make sure folder is selected. Click Choose and select the lowres jpeg folder you created. Make sure the file path reads the correct destination.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click OK.</li>
  <li>After Photoshop has completed the action, make sure all the images have been saved to the correct folder.</li>
  <li>Email Jess when you have completed a folder, box, or project and have converted all files to both access jpeg and lowres jpeg.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="converting-to-pdf">Converting to PDF</h5>

<ol>
  <li>Select file/s to be converted from your lowres jpeg folder.</li>
  <li>Right-click once items are selected and select either “Convert to Adobe PDF” or “Combine supported files in Acrobat”</li>
  <li>Under Tools, select Recognize Text &gt; In this file.</li>
  <li>Wait until Adobe Acrobat completes the command (the document will end up back at the first page).</li>
  <li>Save the document as a PDF following the naming rules established on Scanning Images and Documents.</li>
  <li>Email Jess when you have completed a folder, box, or project and have converted all files to both access jpeg and lowres jpeg.</li>
</ol>
